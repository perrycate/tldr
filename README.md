# TL;DR
I'll think of a better name later. Maybe.

Built with [Serum](https://dalgona.github.io/Serum/getting-started.html) so I
have more of a chance of fixing things when it breaks.

This will be my personal website in 2020, in which I will write TL;DRs of books
I read as part of my new year's resolution.

## To Build

    mix do deps.get, deps.compile
    mix serum.build
