title: Climate Change Resources

These are the resources I found most helpful when learning about climate
change.

# Start Here

If you are new to the space, I highly recommend [Climate Change: What Everyone
Needs to Know](TODO link) by Joe Romm.
This book is an approachable but comprehensive overview that assumes no prior
knowledge.
It covers the scientific consensus on climate change, its future impacts,
obstacles, and potential solutions.
The entire book is structured as an extended Q&A, with each 3-4 page section
answering a specific question that appears in the index.
The sources are well-cited, so this book serves as an excellent launching point
for deeper dives if the reader is so inclined.
Make sure you have the most recent edition.
As of July 2023, this is the Third Edition, published (TODO publish date).

If you're looking for work, join the [Work on Climate](TODO link) community.
Their slack organization is massive, with a huge number of resources and job
postings.
For in-person events, check for a region-specific channel to join.
The #meet-sf-bay-area channel is how I hear about all the climate related
events near me.
