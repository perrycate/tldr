title: I summarize books
---

*Hello, world!*

My name is Perry Cate. For my New Year's resolution, I decided to summarize
20 interesting books by the end of 2020. You've stumbled onto the site
where I'm keeping these summaries!


## Progress So Far

It took much longer that I had hoped, but I've finished my second (technically
first) TL;DR! Next I'm doing Deep Work, also by Cal Newport.

 by Cal Newport
1. [Peak](/posts/peak.html) by Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool


## Who Am I?
Mind your own business. Just kidding, mostly. I don't have much of a social
media presence and don't like to give out personal information, but if you're
near San Francisco [let me know](https://forms.gle/huEg4BZamYYw2Jcp6). Maybe we
could meet up for coffee or something.
