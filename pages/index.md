title: I summarize books
---

*Hello, world!*

My name is Perry Cate. For my New Year's resolution, I decided to summarize
20 interesting books by the end of 2020. You've stumbled onto the site
where I'm keeping these summaries!


## Progress So Far
I've added my [first post](/posts/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you.html), but
_technically_ it doesn't count. I made my original summary of So Good They
Can't Ignore You in late 2019, so I'm not treating it as one of my 20 tldrs for
the year. That book inspired me to start this website (among other things), so
it seemed fitting to have it be the first thing I added.
