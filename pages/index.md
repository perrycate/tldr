*Hello, world!*

My name is Perry Cate. I'm a software developer with an interest in Climate Change.
This place is a dumping ground for (rare) public thoughts.

## History of the site

In early 2020 I decided to summarize 20 interesting books by the end of the year.
That lasted all of a month before the pandemic hit, and my priorities shifted.
You can still find a couple summaries [here](/posts/) though.

In fall 2021 I started learning about climate change.
One year later, I left my job at Google to join a climate-related startup.
For anyone potentially interested in following my footsteps, (TODO link here).

## Who Am I?
Mind your own business. Just kidding, mostly. I don't have much of a social
media presence and don't like to give out personal information, but here's my
linkedin. (TODO link here).
