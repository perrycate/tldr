## Ability to concentrate is increasingly necessary
Economy shifting to knowledge work

Must master hard things
Must produce at elite level in speed and quality

Deep work lets you do both

? Caveat re: some non-deep jobs


## Ability to concentrate is increasingly rare
Deep work is hard to come by

Busyness vs productivity


## ?Deep work can make you happier



## ?Maybe clarify what deep work is/prerequisites for it





Rules (For what objective?)


1. Work deeply

Monastic approach

Bimodal approach

Rhythmic approach

Journalistic approach

Ritualize

Make Grand Gestures

Don't work alone

Execute like a business/the 4 disciplines
% this is basically "how to get started"

1. Focus on the wildly important

Identify a small number of ambitious outcomes to pursue in deepwork.
"If you want to win the war for attention, don't try to say no to the trivial
distractions you find on the information smorgasbord; try to say yes to the
subject that arouses a terrifying longing, and let the terrifying longing crowd
out everything else."
--David brooks
Set ambitious projects with a tangible reward.

2. Act on the lead measures

Lag measures: describe the thing you're trying to improve
 * eg customer satisfaction, or papers written per year
 * The come too late to change the behavior - whatever caused this metric to be
    bad has already happened.

Lead measure: measure the new behaviors that will drive success on the lag measures
 * eg number of free samples given out
 * Can directly increase it

In other words, focus on the things you directly control in the immediate future
For deep work: time spent in a state of deep work dedicated toward your wildly
important goal

3. Keep a compelling scoreboard

 * physical artifact that displays current deep work hour count


4. Create a cadence of accountability

 * Do a weekly review planning for the workweek ahead.





Be Lazy
Downtime:
aids insights
helps recharge energy
work that downtime replaces usually isn't important

Shutdown schedule
Zeigarnik effect (incomplete tasks dominate our attention)


2. Embrace Boredom

Concentrating intensely must be trained

Constant distraction makes that harder

"Don't take breaks from distraction, take breaks from focus"

Schedule in advance when you can be distracted
1. Works even if job requires lots of internet and/or prompt email replies
2. Time outside of internet blocks must be _absolutely_ free from internet
3. You should schedule it at home, too

Work like Teddy Roosevelt
Identify a deep task, get estimate
Set deadline that drastically undercuts estimate

Meditate productively
1. Be wary of distractions and looping
2. Structure your deep thinking

Memorize a deck of cards


3. Quit social media

Idea of "internet sabbatical" is too crude to be useful

How we choose internet tools is flawed
Any-benefit vs craftsman approach

Apply the law of the vital few

Quit social media (interesting... is subheading too.)

Digital declutter (?)

Don't use the internet for entertainment

Make deliberate use of time


4. Drain the Shallows

4 hour work week is viable -> shallow work is less important than we think

Schedule every minute of your day
block time

Quantify depth of every activity
metrics for doing so

Ask your boss for a shallow work budget

Finish your work by 5:30

Become hard to reach
1. Make people who send you email do more work
2. Do more work when you send or reply to emails
3. Don't respond
