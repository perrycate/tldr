## Ability to concentrate is increasingly valuable
Economy shifting to knowledge work

Must master hard things
Must produce at elite level in speed and quality

Deep work lets you do both

Deep work is hard to come by

Busyness vs productivity


## ?Deep work can make you happier

Rules (For what objective?)


1. Work deeply

Monastic approach

Bimodal approach

Rhythmic approach

Journalistic approach

Ritualize

Make Grand Gestures

Don't work alone

Execute like a business/the 4 disciplines

1. Focus on the wildly important
2. Act on the lead measures
3. Keep a compelling scoreboard
4. Create a cadence of accountability

Be Lazy
Downtime:
aids insights
helps recharge energy
work that downtime replaces usually isn't important

Shutdown schedule
Zeigarnik effect (incomplete tasks dominate our attention)


2. Embrace Boredom

Concentrating intensely must be trained

Constant distraction makes that harder

"Don't take breaks from distraction, take breaks from focus"

Schedule in advance when you can be distracted
1. Works even if job requires lots of internet and/or prompt email replies
2. Time outside of internet blocks must be _absolutely_ free from internet
3. You should schedule it at home, too

Work like Teddy Roosevelt
Identify a deep task, get estimate
Set deadline that drastically undercuts estimate

Meditate productively
1. Be wary of distractions and looping
2. Structure your deep thinking

Memorize a deck of cards


3. Quit social media

Idea of "internet sabbatical" is too crude to be useful

How we choose internet tools is flawed
Any-benefit vs craftsman approach

Apply the law of the vital few

Quit social media (interesting... is subheading too.)

Digital declutter (?)

Don't use the internet for entertainment

Make deliberate use of time


4. Drain the Shallows

4 hour work week is viable -> shallow work is less important than we think

Schedule every minute of your day
block time

Quantify depth of every activity
metrics for doing so

Ask your boss for a shallow work budget

Finish your work by 5:30

Become hard to reach
1. Make people who send you email do more work
2. Do more work when you send or reply to emails
3. Don't respond
