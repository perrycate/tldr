In this book Anders Ericsson ("the Expert expert") explains just how amazingly
adaptable our brains are, and how we can best leverage that fact.

**TL;DR** - Stay out of your comfort zone, follow an established regimen (if
possible), have well-defined and specific goals, and get lots of feedback,
ideally from a very good teacher.

## Humans can get dramatically better at things in a short timespan
Examples:
 * In 2 years Steve Faloon went from an average digit memorization ability (could
    remember ~7 digits at a time) to 82, a shocking increase for his time.
 * Between 1973 and 2015 the world record for digits of pi memorized went from
    511 to 70,000.
 * In the early 1930s, Alfred Cortot was one of the best musicians, and his
    recordings of Chopin's "24 Etudes" were considered amazing. Now it's an
    example of horribly sloppy play.
 * The marathon record in 1908 was 2 hours, 55 minutes, 8 seconds. Now the
    world record is 2 hours, 2 minutes, 57 seconds. The old record would barely
    qualify for the Boston Marathon.
 * In 1908 the double somersault was nearly banned from Olympic diving for being
    "too dangerous". Now it's entry-level, and 10-year-olds can do it.

In the 20th century there was a huge increase in the _time_ and _techniques_ for
practicing these things.

> follow the same set of principles."

## Our brains are amazing
Even as adults, our brains can change in dramatic ways due to stimulus.

 * The part of the brain used for remembering places (part of the hippocampus) is gigantic in London cabbies
    * The exam to become an official London cabbie is considered one of the hardest
       tests in the world.
    * Prior to (the years long process of) preparing for it, all subjects had
       average sized hippocampi
    * After 4 years, the ones that had not dropped out now had much larger hippocampi.
       Those that had dropped out were closer to average sized.
    * MRIs of experienced cabbies showed that the longer they had been a cabbie,
       the bigger that part of the brain was.
 * Blind people's _visual_ cortex activates up when they "read" braille with
    their fingertips
    * Skilled braille readers may use 3 fingers to "read" 3 lines at once.
    * They can detect _much_ more gentle touches to those fingers.
 * Older people suffering from age-related farsightedness were able to train their
    brains to compensate for it.
    * Subjects spent 30 minutes 3x/week for 3 months performing an exercise
       where they had to spot small images against a very similarly-colored
       background.
    * After 3 months they could on average read text that was 60% smaller than
       they initially could, and read it faster. 
    * Every subject was now able to read a newspaper without glasses. (Most
       couldn't initially.)
    * Their eyes were just as bad as before, but their brains had learned how
       to "de-blur" the images.

**If you practice the right way, your brain (and body) can adapt to do some
amazing stuff.**

## Mental Representations

As we get better at a task, our brains get better at recognizing patterns
and encoding information related to that task.

#### Our short-term memory is really bad
 * We can only hold about 7 things in our mind at once.
    * Most people can repeat back a string of 7 digits (plus or minus one)
       immediately after hearing them, but no more.
    * This appears to be a general limit
    * Makes it impossible to focus on many things at once. Some examples:
       * Notes in a song
       * Positions in a football play
       * Sequence of movements to shoot a 3-point goal

#### Mental Representations get around these limitations
 * As we practice a skill, our brain rewires itself to recognize common
    patterns and leverage long-term memory.
 * **Mental Representations**: Adaptations that occur in our brain to aid the
    brain in performing some task.
 * This is why, when we walk, we don't have to focus on extending and flexing
    our leg muscles.
    * We decide we want to walk somewhere, and our legs know what to do.
    * Our brain has stored the necessary sequence of movements in long-term
       memory, so we don't have to use up precious slots in short-term memory
       just to walk properly.
 * Types of mental representations vary greatly, and are a relatively new field
    of study.
 * In general, they are what allow complicated tasks to become second nature to
    experts.

#### Examples:
 * Chess grandmasters
    * Can remember the positions of most or all of the pieces on a chessboard
       after only a couple seconds of looking at the board, but if you put the
       pieces in a position that could not occur during a real chess game they
       are no better at remembering the positions than a novice.
    * Tend to be very good at playing chess blindfolded without putting much
       practice into doing so.
 * Pro divers
    * Must have lots of control over their bodies in a short timespan, and they
       do it pretty much unconsciously (after lots of practicing).
    * Similar to how when we walk we don't have to think about which leg
       muscles to use.
 * Others
    * Memory competitors encode information (like long strings of digits) in
       "memory palaces"
    * Baseball players tend to not have much better eyesight or reflexes than
       most people, but are able to react to the pitcher's movements muuuch faster.
    * Pro musicians can "hear" the music in their head just by reading the
       sheet music.

**The better our mental representations are, the better we are at practicing**.

Having better mental representations makes it easier to recognize what we're
doing wrong and figure out how to correct our mistakes.

**The better our practice is, the more efficiently we can develop our mental
representations**
"Good" practice should be designed around helping our brains form those mental
representations as quickly as possible.

## Most people practice the wrong way

**Naive Practice**: Mindlessly and repeatedly doing the same
routine, expecting to get better for some reason. Research shows that once one
reaches basic proficiency in the task, this is no longer effective.

Examples:
 * Playing a game (Tennis, Smash, Chess, etc) repeatedly, hoping to improve
 * Practicing music without feedback
 * Diagnosing patients without later learning if you were correct.

Better approach: **Purposeful Practice**
 * Has well defined, specific goals
 * FOCUS! Has your full attention while you're doing it.
 * Direct feedback. Focus not on whether you're correct, but on what you're
    doing wrong and why.
 * _Stay out of your comfort zone._ Keep your goals just on the opposite side of
    what you're capable of.

Purposeful Practice has limits - trying hard and staying uncomfortable aren't
enough.

The best approach: **Deliberate Practice**

## Deliberate Practice

Deliberate Practice is Purposeful Practice with the following additions:
 * Use well-established training techniques designed and overseen by
    a teacher or coach.
 * Make sure you have rock-solid fundamentals. You'll be building on them.
 * _Do not_ just follow your teacher's directions. Concentrate on your specific
    goal and on figuring out what adjustments need to be made to your
    performance.
 * Modify your training in response to feedback, and gradually learn how to
    monitor and spot your own mistakes.
 * Focus on refining your mental representations.
    * What types of common patterns do you see?
    * What is most important to keep track of as you perform the activity?

### What if your field isn't well established or doesn't have established best training practices?
 * Study the best in the field and figure out what specifically enables them to
    perform so well
 * Judge who is the "best" by the most objective, reproducible metrics you can
    come up with
 * Tip: Seek out the judgement of people that have to work closely with many
    other professionals, such as a nurse that is on many surgery teams (if
    figuring out who's the best surgeon), or a coach who coaches the best.
 * Mimic their training techniques:
    * What do they do differently?
    * What are their mental representations?

### Deliberate Practice at Work

Avoid the "business as usual" mindset! Remember:

 * Your abilities are _not_ limited by born traits. Avoid "I can't", or "I'm not good at \___" thinking.
 * Doing something a lot does _not_ mean you'll get better at it.
 * Effort is _not_ all you need to improve.

Everything is an opportunity for feedback and improvement. Make the most of it!

#### Seek repeatable, real-world scenarios with a low cost of failure
 * In the late 60s, the U.S. Navy set up a fighter jet training program ("Top Gun") 
    in which the best pilots they had fought their second best fighters
    (without bullets)
 * No curriculum, just many, many dogfights but without the dying
 * After 1 year, the rate of enemy fighters shot down per U.S. fighters lost went
    from 1 : 1 to 12.5 : 1!

#### Ask questions to yourself
Every day in the Top Gun program after the fighting stopped, the trainers would
grill the students:
 * What did you notice while you were up there?
 * What actions did you take? Why?
 * What were your mistakes? What could you have done differently?

Eventually the students automatically would ask themselves these questions, and
you should too.

### Deliberate Practice IRL - tips and tricks

#### Can't find a good teacher?. Focus on the 3 Fs:

**Focus** - Be fully engaged in your practice. Concentrate intently on the details of what you're doing.
**Feedback** - Analyze what you're doing and what's going wrong. When and why are you making mistakes?
**Fix it** - Figure out ways to practice more effectively and address your mistakes 

#### Stuck at a plateau? Try to challenge yourself in a different way:
* Mix up the routine
* Modify parameters
* Try pushing yourself harder than usual, allowing yourself to fail. What do you mess up on first? Where do the mistakes come from?

#### Having motivation issues?

 * Develop an official regimen (Ideally at least 1 hour/day)
 * Allocate dedicated, regular time for your routine in your schedule
 * Minimize distractions (turn phone off and put in another room, etc)
 * Surround yourself with people who support your endeavors. (Supportive friends and/or others who are doing the same thing)
 * Focus on one small, manageable goal (can be totally arbitrary) at a time so you can see improvement more easily
 
It will get easier to stick to your regimen as you mind/body adapts to the routine

#### Side note: "Willpower genes" aren't a thing
There's very little scientific evidence that some people just have bigger
"willpower reserves". People who study obsessively in one field aren't any more
dedicated than everyone else people in unrelated fields.


## Pathway of a Prodigy

Research suggests that becoming the literal best in the world at something
depends more on how you were raised, rather than inherent gifts. Researchers
identified 3 stages of development common to the development of 120 experts
(best in their field) in piano, swimming, tennis, mathematics, research
neurology, and sculpting. The patterns seem to also be present in other fields.


### Sometimes you have to start young

For many fields, there aren't any physical limitations for adults that can't be
overcome. (Usually lack of free time matters much more.) That said, there are
some cases where you have to start as a child:

 * Physical ability: We peak at a certain age, and if you start later your body
    can't adapt as well.
    * Certain hip and knee joints calcify (turn from cartilage to bone) around
       10 years old. Ballerinas have to start before then or they can never
       develop the same range of motion they otherwise would.
    * Skeletal adaptations (such as tennis players' dominant arm bones becoming
       up to 20% denser than their other arm) will be more significant if they
       happen during puberty
    * Age of athletes is increasing with modern technology though
 * Brain development: Some (not all) parts of the brain in professional
    musicians are only enlarged if they started before 7.
    * Science of this is not well understood yet.

* However, not insurmountable: perfect pitch for example can be improved via training


### Steps to becoming a prodigy

(Perry's note - I do not necessarily condone treating your child as an experiment.)

#### 1. Starting out
 * Child (around age 1-3) is introduced to the field they are to become experts
    in.
 * Introduction occurs via play. Examples:
    * Playing with Chess pieces and arranging them on a board
    * Throwing a ball
    * Organizing marbles by shape or pattern

#### 2. Becoming serious

 * In physical fields such as skating, the child begins deliberate practice
    with a coach.
    * The first instructors must be good with kids, to foster their enthusiasm.
    * Parents work with the kids establish practice routines and ~~force them~~
       help them stick to it
 * In other fields like math, the students probably won't have a tutor
    * Their teachers still help spark their interest and intellectual curiosity.
    * More of a focus on _why_ than _how_ when solving problems.
 * In this stage it's important that the child gets lots of positive encouragement
    from parents and teachers.
    * As the child progresses, they become increasingly self-motivated.
    * Eventually the child will seek to improve without any prompting necessary,
       as their skill becomes part of their identity.

#### 3. Commitment

 * Around early- to mid-teens, the child makes a commitment to become the best they
    can be.
 * The child seeks out increasingly prominent teachers - often those who have
    themselves reached the highest levels in the field.
 * The dedication to the field basically becomes the child's entire life.
 * Motivation lies solely with the child, but the family still plays a crucial role:
    * May need to move across the country to train with the best coach
    * Often requires that the family have tons of money for lessons, transportation, tournaments, academies, etc.

### Each new prodigy paves the way for other experts

 * Others learn from the best in the field.
    * Maybe the best shares their techniques
    * Maybe the others just observe what the best is doing and imitate
    * Maybe just the knowledge of what is now possible is enough to motivate new challengers.

## The role of "Natural Talent"

### The idea of being gifted from birth at something is not supported by science

#### Child prodigies
From last section, not about inherent gifts but about relentless discipline from
a young age

Mozart, other examples?

#### Anti-prodigies
 * "Tone deaf"

### "Mental Ability" is pretty bogus

#### (Lack of) correlation between IQ and skill at mental tasks
Define IQ
IQ correlation at low levels of chess
slight _negative_ correlation at elite levels

#### IQs and researchers

### When people say "I'm not good at something" it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Hockey players




No correlation between skill levels of junior athletes and elite athletes

### NTS
 * Hours spent matters a lot (96), but the 10K hour "rule" isn't a rule (109)
