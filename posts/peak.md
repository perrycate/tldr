In this book Anders Ericsson (the "Expert" expert) explains just how amazingly
adaptable our brains are, and how we can best leverage that fact.

**TL;DR** - Stay out of your comfort zone, follow an established regimen (if
possible), have well-defined and specific goals, and get lots of feedback,
ideally from a very good teacher.

## Humans can get dramatically better at things in a short timespan
Examples:
 * In 2 years Steve Faloon went from an average digit memorization ability (could
    remember ~7 digits at a time) to 82, a shocking increase for his time.
 * Between 1973 and 2015 the world record for digits of pi memorized went from
    511 to 70,000.
 * In the early 1930s, Alfred Cortot was one of the best musicians, and his
    recordings of Chopin's "24 Etudes" were considered amazing. Now it's an
    example of horribly sloppy play.
 * The marathon record in 1908 was 2 hours, 55 minutes, 8 seconds. Now the
    world record is 2 hours, 2 minutes, 57 seconds. The old record would barely
    qualify for the Boston Marathon.
 * In 1908 the double somersault was nearly banned from Olympic diving for being
    "too dangerous". Now it's entry-level, and 10-year-olds can do it.

In the 20th century there was a huge increase in the _time_ and _techniques_ for
practicing these things.

> follow the same set of principles."

## Our brains are amazing
Even as adults, our brains can change in dramatic ways due to stimulus.

 * The part of the brain used for remembering places (part of the hippocampus) is gigantic in London cabbies
    * The exam to become an official London cabbie is considered one of the hardest
       tests in the world.
    * Prior to (the years long process of) preparing for it, all subjects had
       average sized hippocampi
    * After 4 years, the ones that had not dropped out now had much larger hippocampi.
       Those that had dropped out were closer to average sized.
    * MRIs of experienced cabbies showed that the longer they had been a cabbie,
       the bigger that part of the brain was.
 * Blind people's _visual_ cortex activates up when they "read" braille with
    their fingertips
    * Skilled braille readers may use 3 fingers to "read" 3 lines at once.
    * They can detect _much_ more gentle touches to those fingers, but cannot
       determine which one of the 3 fingers was touched.
 * Older people suffering from age-related farsightedness were able to train their
    brains to compensate for it.
    * Subjects spent 30 minutes 3x/week for 3 months performing an exercise
       where they had to spot small images against a very similarly-colored
       background.
    * After 3 months they could on average read text that was 60% smaller than
       they initially could, and read it faster. 
    * Every subject was now able to read a newspaper without glasses. (Most
       couldn't initially.)
    * Their eyes were just as bad as before, but their brains had learned how
       to "de-blur" the images.

**If you practice the right way, your brain (and body) can adapt to do some
amazing stuff.**

## Mental Representations

As we get better at something, our brains get better at recognizing patterns
and encoding information.

Mental representations tend to be preexisting information (faces, combinations
of muscle movements, board positions, whatever) stored in long term memory.
  * Makes it easy to recall and apply without using up our finite short term
     mental capacity

Examples:
 * Chess grandmasters
    * Can remember the positions of most or all of the pieces on a chessboard
       after only a couple seconds of looking at the board, but if you put the
       pieces in a position that could not occur during a real chess game they
       are no better at remembering the positions than a novice.
    * Tend to be very good at playing chess blindfolded without putting much
       practice into doing so.
 * Pro divers
    * Must have lots of control over their bodies in a short timespan, and they
       do it pretty much unconsciously (after lots of practicing).
    * Similar to how when we walk we don't have to think about which leg
       muscles to use.
 * Others
    * Memory competitors encode information (like long strings of digits) in
       "memory palaces"
    * Baseball players tend to not have much better eyesight or reflexes than
       most people, but are able to react to the pitcher's movements muuuch faster.
    * Pro musicians can "hear" the music in their head just by reading the
       sheet music.

Psychologists are just beginning to study the role of mental representations in
expertise, but this much is known:

**The better our mental representations are, the better we are at practicing**.
Better representations allow us to better recognize when and how we make
mistakes when we practice.

**The better our practice is, the more efficiently we can develop our mental
representations**


## Most people practice the wrong way

**Naive Practice**: Mindlessly and repeatedly doing the same
routine, expecting to get better for some reason. Research shows that once one
reaches basic proficiency in the task, this is no longer effective.

Examples:
 * Playing a game (Tennis, Smash, Chess, etc) repeatedly, hoping to improve
 * Practicing music without feedback
 * Diagnosing patients without knowing the outcomes. (fun fact: Doctors actually
    tend to get worse over time. Surgeons are the exception.)

Better approach: **Purposeful Practice**
 * Has well defined, specific goals
 * FOCUS! Has your full attention while you're doing it.
 * Direct feedback. Focus not on whether you're correct, but on what you're
    doing wrong and why.
 * _Stay out of your comfort zone._ Keep your goals just on the opposite side of
    what you're capable of.

Purposeful Practice has limits - trying hard and staying uncomfortable aren't
enough.

The best approach: **Deliberate Practice**

## Deliberate Practice

Prerequisites:
 * Well established, competitive fields with objective(ish) success criteria
 * A teacher who can provide individual practice activities to help rapidly
    develop your mental representations

Deliberate Practice is Purposeful Practice with the following additions:
 * Use well-established training techniques designed and overseen by
    a teacher or coach.
 * _Do not_ just follow your teacher's directions. Concentrate on your specific
    goal and on figuring out what adjustments need to be made to your
    performance.
 * Modify your answers in response to feedback, and gradually learn how to
    monitor and spot your own mistakes.
 * Focus on refining your mental representations.
 * Make sure you have rock-solid fundamentals. You'll be building on them.

### What if your field isn't well established or doesn't have established best training practices?
 * Study the best in the field and figure out what specifically enables them to
    perform so well
 * Judge who is the "best" by the most objective, reproducible metrics you can
    come up with
 * Tip: Seek out the judgement of people that have to work closely with many
    other professionals, such as a nurse that is on many surgery teams (if
    figuring out who's the best surgeon), or a coach who coaches the best.
