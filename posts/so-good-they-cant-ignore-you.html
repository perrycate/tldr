Just
pick <em>something</em> and get really good at it.</p><h2 id="rule-#1:-don’t-follow-your-passion">Rule #1: Don’t follow your passion</h2><h3 id="“follow-your-passion”-(aka-the-passion-hypothesis)-is-bad-career-advice">“Follow your passion” (aka the <em>passion hypothesis</em>) is bad career advice</h3><ul><li>Most people don’t have pre-existing passions like that, and if they do then
 it won’t live up to their expectations.
</li><li>Trying (and probably failing) to find your “true passion” up front will just
 lead to confusion and unhappiness.
</li><li>Career passions are rare, take time to build, and are a side effect of
 mastery.
</li></ul><h3 id="scientifically-backed-elements-of-a-fulfilling-workplace-environment-(self-determination-theory):">Scientifically-backed elements of a fulfilling workplace environment (Self-Determination Theory):</h3><ul><li><strong>Autonomy</strong> - you have control over your day
</li><li><strong>Mastery</strong> - you feel you are good at what you do
</li><li><strong>Relatedness</strong> - you feel a connection to other people/have a purpose for
  your work  
</li></ul><blockquote><p>“Working right trumps finding the right work”</p></blockquote><h2 id="rule-#2:-be-so-good-they-can’t-ignore-you">Rule #2: Be so good they can’t ignore you</h2><p>Skill is really important! Focus on that instead of finding your “passion”.</p><ul><li><strong>The Craftsman mindset</strong> - focus on what value you’re producing in your job.
  <em>Do this!</em></li><li><strong>The Passion mindset</strong> - focus on what value your job offers you. Most
  people do this. <em>Don’t!</em></li></ul><blockquote><p>“…put aside the question of whether your job is your true passion, and
instead turn your focus toward becoming so good they can’t ignore you.”</p></blockquote><h3 id="traits-that-define-great-work:">Traits that define great work:</h3><ul><li><strong>Creativity</strong></li><li><strong>Impact</strong></li><li><strong>Control</strong> &lt;- the most important<br/>(Note the similarities to SDT)
</li></ul><h3 id="you-should-do-everything-you-can-to-get-a-job-with-those^-three-qualities.-how?-“career-capital”!">You should do everything you can to get a job with those^ three qualities. How? “Career Capital”!</h3><ul><li>The traits that define great work are rare and valuable.
</li><li>Economics - if you want rare and valuable work, you need rare and valuable
 skills to offer. We call those skills <strong>career capital</strong>.
</li><li>The craftsman mindset is well suited for building career capital
</li><li>The passion mindset often convinces people to quit their jobs to change
 careers, throwing away their career capital!
</li></ul><p>Steve Jobs once told everyone to follow their passion, but if you look at his
career he definitely didn’t. He had a craftsman mindset.</p><h3 id="3-exceptions/disqualifiers-for-applying-the-craftsman-mindset">3 Exceptions/Disqualifiers for applying the craftsman mindset</h3><p>Don’t bother applying the craftsman mindset if the job:</p><ol><li>Presents few opportunities to distinguish yourself by developing career
capital
</li><li>Focuses on something you think is useless or actively bad for the world
</li><li>Forces you to work with people you really dislike  
</li></ol><p>(If this is the case then you should quit your job.)</p><h3 id="how-to-build-career-capital">How to build Career Capital</h3><p><strong>Deliberate Practice</strong>: Stretching yourself beyond your current abilities, with immediate,
   thoughtful feedback (usually from coaches)</p><ul><li><p>Example: The best predictor of Chess success is not hours played, but is
hours spent in serious study:</p><ul><li>Poring over books on strategy
</li><li>Using teachers to identify and eliminate weaknesses
</li><li>Studying grandmaster’s games  
</li></ul></li><li>Deliberate practice is well known for chess, music, physical sports, etc.,
but not for knowledge work
</li><li>If you adopt it, you’ll quickly outpace your peers.
</li></ul><p>Beware the <strong>OK Plateau</strong>: “If you just show up and work hard [(ie without
deliberate practice)], you’ll soon hit a performance plateau beyond which
you’ll fail to get any better.”</p><h3 id="the-five-habits-of-a-craftsman">The Five Habits of a Craftsman</h3><ol><li><p>Decide what capital market you’re in:</p><ul><li><strong>Winner-take-all</strong> - there’s only one type of career capital, and everyone
competes for it (eg writing skill)
</li><li><strong>Auction</strong> - Many types of career capital, and each person may have unique
collection with fine additions
</li></ul></li><li><p>Identify capital type:</p><ul><li>In a winner-take-all market, this is trivial: Do the one type that matters
</li><li>In an auction market, seek “<strong>open gates</strong>” - opportunities that are open to
you (but not to everyone)
</li></ul></li><li><p>Define “good”.</p><ul><li>There should be no ambiguity
</li><li><p>Examples:</p><ul><li>Music playing: Learning some complicated technique
</li><li>TV writing: scripts being taken seriously
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Stretch and Destroy</p><ul><li>If you’re enjoying your practice, you’re probably not trying hard enough,
and will hit the OK plateau
</li><li>Make yourself uncomfortable with the difficulty
</li><li>Get honest, harsh feedback
</li></ul></li><li><p>Be patient</p><ul><li>It takes time. Sorry.
</li><li>Keep your focus. Don’t constantly switch pursuits!
</li></ul></li></ol><h3 id="cal’s-strategies-for-applying-the-craftsman-mindset-(he-is-a-computer-science-academic):">Cal’s strategies for applying the Craftsman mindset (he is a computer science academic):</h3><ol><li><p><em>Keep a “Research Bible”</em></p><ul><li><p>Once per week, he summarizes a paper he thinks might be relevant to his
research:</p><ul><li>Description
</li><li>Comparison to prior work
</li><li>Main strategies to attain it
</li></ul></li><li>Introduces the strain of deliberate practice towards digesting research
papers. (Fun fact: this is what inspired me to start this project!)
</li></ul></li><li><p><em>Maintain an “Hour-Tally”</em></p><ul><li>Sheet of paper behind his desk with a row for each month
</li><li>Tally for each months of the # of hours spent in a state of deliberate
practice
</li><li>Motivates him to find more ways to fit deliberate practice into his schedule
</li></ul></li><li><p><em>Have a “Theory-Notebook”</em></p><ul><li>He bought the most expensive notebook he could find to record brainstorming
sessions
</li><li>The price helps signal the importance of it to himself
</li><li>Strain to collect and organize his thinking == Deliberate practice.
