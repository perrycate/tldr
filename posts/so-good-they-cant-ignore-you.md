This book is Cal Newport's philosophy about how to find work that you love. 

**TL;DR** - Don't worry about finding something you're "passionate about". Just
pick _something_ and get really good at it.

## Rule #1: Don't follow your passion

### “Follow your passion” (aka the *passion hypothesis*) is bad career advice
 * Most people don’t have pre-existing passions like that, and if they do then
    it won’t live up to their expectations.
 * Trying (and probably failing) to find your “true passion” up front will just
    lead to confusion and unhappiness.
 * Career passions are rare, take time to build, and are a side effect of
    mastery.

### Scientifically-backed elements of a fulfilling workplace environment (Self-Determination Theory):
 * **Autonomy** - you have control over your day
 * **Mastery** - you feel you are good at what you do
 * **Relatedness** - you feel a connection to other people/have a purpose for
     your work  
> “Working right trumps finding the right work”


## Rule #2: Be so good they can't ignore you

Skill is really important! Focus on that instead of finding your "passion".

 * **The Craftsman mindset** - focus on what value you're producing in your job.
     _Do this!_
 * **The Passion mindset** - focus on what value your job offers you. Most
     people do this. _Don't!_

> “...put aside the question of whether your job is your true passion, and
> instead turn your focus toward becoming so good they can’t ignore you.”

### Traits that define great work:
 * **Creativity**
 * **Impact**
 * **Control** <- the most important  
(Note the similarities to SDT)

### You should do everything you can to get a job with those^ three qualities. How? "Career Capital"!
 * The traits that define great work are rare and valuable.
 * Economics - if you want rare and valuable work, you need rare and valuable
    skills to offer. We call those skills **career capital**.
 * The craftsman mindset is well suited for building career capital
 * The passion mindset often convinces people to quit their jobs to change
    careers, throwing away their career capital!

Steve Jobs once told everyone to follow their passion, but if you look at his
career he definitely didn’t. He had a craftsman mindset.

### 3 Exceptions/Disqualifiers for applying the craftsman mindset
Don’t bother applying the craftsman mindset if the job:
1. Presents few opportunities to distinguish yourself by developing career
   capital
2. Focuses on something you think is useless or actively bad for the world
3. Forces you to work with people you really dislike  

(If this is the case then you should quit your job.)

### How to build Career Capital
**Deliberate Practice**: Stretching yourself beyond your current abilities, with immediate,
   thoughtful feedback (usually from coaches)
 * Example: The best predictor of Chess success is not hours played, but is
   hours spent in serious study:
    * Poring over books on strategy
    * Using teachers to identify and eliminate weaknesses
    * Studying grandmaster’s games  
 * Deliberate practice is well known for chess, music, physical sports, etc.,
   but not for knowledge work
 * If you adopt it, you’ll quickly outpace your peers.

Beware the **OK Plateau**: “If you just show up and work hard [(ie without
deliberate practice)], you’ll soon hit a performance plateau beyond which
you’ll fail to get any better.”

### The Five Habits of a Craftsman

1. Decide what capital market you’re in:
    * **Winner-take-all** - there’s only one type of career capital, and everyone
      competes for it (eg writing skill)
    * **Auction** - Many types of career capital, and each person may have unique
      collection with fine additions
2. Identify capital type:
    * In a winner-take-all market, this is trivial: Do the one type that matters
    * In an auction market, seek “**open gates**” - opportunities that are open to
      you (but not to everyone)
3. Define “good”.
    * There should be no ambiguity
    * Examples:
       * Music playing: Learning some complicated technique
       * TV writing: scripts being taken seriously
4. Stretch and Destroy
    * If you’re enjoying your practice, you’re probably not trying hard enough,
      and will hit the OK plateau
    * Make yourself uncomfortable with the difficulty
    * Get honest, harsh feedback
5. Be patient
    * It takes time. Sorry.
    * Keep your focus. Don’t constantly switch pursuits!

### Cal’s strategies for applying the Craftsman mindset (he is a computer science academic):
1. _Keep a "Research Bible"_
    * Once per week, he summarizes a paper he thinks might be relevant to his
      research:
       * Description
       * Comparison to prior work
       * Main strategies to attain it
    * Introduces the strain of deliberate practice towards digesting research
      papers. (Fun fact: this is what inspired me to start this project!)

2. _Maintain an "Hour-Tally"_
    * Sheet of paper behind his desk with a row for each month
    * Tally for each months of the # of hours spent in a state of deliberate
      practice
    * Motivates him to find more ways to fit deliberate practice into his schedule

3. _Have a "Theory-Notebook"_
    * He bought the most expensive notebook he could find to record brainstorming
      sessions
    * The price helps signal the importance of it to himself
    * Strain to collect and organize his thinking == Deliberate practice.

### Rule #3: Turn down a promotion
